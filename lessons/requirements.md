## Requirements

In order to build and deploy the worker you only need **NodeJS (v10 to v12 LTS)**.
Besides that, you need to have access to couple of services.

### Access to Adobe solutions
- You must have an Adobe organization ID, and have access to [Adobe Experience Cloud][experience-cloud]
- Access to AEM as a Cloud service and Adobe IO Runtime. 
- Access to the [Adobe Project Firefly][firefly-doc]. If you don't,
you can still join the prerelease programme, for details see [How to Get Access to Project Firefly][firefly-get-access].

### 3rd party services

- Azure blob storage, so an Azure subscription is required ([Azure free account][azure-free-account] is enough)
- An account on [imgIX service][imgix]. You can sign up to imgIX for free to try it.
